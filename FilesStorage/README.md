# Introduction

The objective of this project is to develop a web-based application that enables users to interact with 3D models directly within a browser window.
Users can upload STEP files, which will be converted into GLB format for efficient rendering.
The application will display the 3D models on the scene, allowing users to rotate and zoom in/out for detailed inspection.
Additionally, a triad (axis indicator) will be displayed to help users orient themselves within the 3D space.
This application aims to provide an intuitive and seamless experience for viewing and manipulating 3D models online.
